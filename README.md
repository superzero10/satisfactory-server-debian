## üìã Prerequisites

- A recent Debian installation.
- Root or sudo access to install packages and configure services.
- Internet access to download the necessary dependencies and files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Instructions

### 1. Install the Satisfactory Server

Run the main script to install and configure the Satisfactory server.

\`\`\`bash
sudo bash install_satisfactory_server.sh
\`\`\`

This script performs the following operations:
- Updates the system.
- Installs the necessary dependencies (SteamCMD, UFW, Fail2Ban, etc.).
- Creates a dedicated user for the server.
- Installs the Satisfactory server via SteamCMD.
- Configures systemd services to manage the server.
- Configures security with UFW and Fail2Ban.
- Sets up logrotate to manage server logs.

### 2. Automated Backups

The `backup_satisfactory.sh` script creates daily backups of the server and deletes backups older than 7 days.

To automate this task, add it to `cron`:

\`\`\`bash
crontab -e
\`\`\`

Add the following line to run it daily at 4 AM:

\`\`\`cron
0 4 * * * /home/satisfactory/backup_satisfactory.sh
\`\`\`

### 3. Automated Updates

The `update_satisfactory.sh` script checks for and applies server updates via SteamCMD, then restarts the server.

Add this script to `cron` to run it daily at 3 AM:

\`\`\`bash
crontab -e
\`\`\`

Add the following line:

\`\`\`cron
0 3 * * * /home/satisfactory/update_satisfactory.sh
\`\`\`

### 4. Daily Restart

The `restart_satisfactory.sh` script restarts the server daily to maintain optimal performance.

Add this script to `cron` to run it daily at 5 AM:

\`\`\`bash
crontab -e
\`\`\`

Add the following line:

\`\`\`cron
0 5 * * * /home/satisfactory/restart_satisfactory.sh
\`\`\`

### 5. Install the Web Interface (AMP)

To install and configure AMP to manage your Satisfactory server, run the following script:

\`\`\`bash
sudo bash install_amp.sh
\`\`\`

This script:
- Installs the prerequisites for AMP.
- Downloads and installs AMP.
- Creates an AMP instance for Satisfactory.
- Configures a firewall to allow access to the AMP web interface.
- (Optional) Configures SSL with Certbot to secure the interface.

After installation, access the AMP interface at `http://your_domain.com:8080`.

## üîí Services and Security Configuration

- **UFW**: Ensure that the UFW firewall is enabled and configured to allow necessary ports.
- **Fail2Ban**: Fail2Ban is configured to protect against unauthorized login attempts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Management and Maintenance

### Main Commands

- **Start the server**: 
  \`\`\`bash
  sudo systemctl start satisfactory
  \`\`\`
- **Stop the server**: 
  \`\`\`bash
  sudo systemctl stop satisfactory
  \`\`\`
- **Restart the server**: 
  \`\`\`bash
  sudo systemctl restart satisfactory
  \`\`\`
- **Check server status**: 
  \`\`\`bash
  sudo systemctl status satisfactory
  \`\`\`

### Backups

Backups are stored in `/home/satisfactory/satisfactory_backups/` and are performed daily, with backups older than 7 days being deleted.

### Updates

The server is automatically updated via the `update_satisfactory.sh` script, which runs daily.

### Restart

The server is automatically restarted daily via the `restart_satisfactory.sh` script, which runs every day at 5 AM.

## üìù Final Remarks

These scripts are designed to make managing a Satisfactory server on Debian easy and efficient, while using AMP for a powerful and intuitive web interface. They can be adapted to meet specific needs. For any questions or suggestions for improvement, feel free to contact me.
