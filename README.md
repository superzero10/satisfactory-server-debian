# üöÄ Satisfactory Server Setup with AMP on Debian/Ubuntu

This repository contains a series of scripts to **install**, **configure**, and **manage** a Satisfactory server on Debian or Ubuntu. The scripts are designed to be **simple**, **automated**, and **easy to use**.

## üóÇ Script Overview

| Script Name                      | Description                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `install_satisfactory_server.sh` | Main script to install the Satisfactory server and configure dependencies. |
| `backup_satisfactory.sh`          | Script to perform daily backups of the server.                           |
| `update_satisfactory.sh`          | Script to automate the daily update of the Satisfactory server.          |
| `restart_satisfactory.sh`         | Script to automatically restart the server every day.                    |
| `install_amp.sh`                  | Script to install and configure AMP (Application Management Panel).      |
| `setup_crontab.sh`                | Script to set up the crontab for automated tasks (backups, updates, restarts). |

## üìã Prerequisites

- A fresh Debian or Ubuntu installation.
- Root or sudo access to install packages and configure services.
- Internet access to download the necessary dependencies and files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Instructions

### 1. Install the Satisfactory Server

Run the main script to install and configure the Satisfactory server.

```bash
sudo bash install_satisfactory_server.sh
```

This script performs the following operations:
- Updates the system.
- Installs the necessary dependencies (SteamCMD, UFW, Fail2Ban, etc.).
- Creates a dedicated user for the server.
- Installs the Satisfactory server via SteamCMD.
- Configures systemd services to manage the server.
- Configures security with UFW and Fail2Ban.
- Sets up logrotate to manage server logs.

### 2. Set Up Automated Backups

The `backup_satisfactory.sh` script creates daily backups of the server and deletes backups older than 7 days.

To automate this task, add it to `cron` using the `setup_crontab.sh` script:

```bash
sudo bash setup_crontab.sh
```

This will schedule the backup script to run daily at 4 AM.

### 3. Automate Daily Updates

The `update_satisfactory.sh` script checks for and applies server updates via SteamCMD, then restarts the server.

This is also set up using the `setup_crontab.sh` script, which schedules it to run daily at 3 AM.

### 4. Automate Daily Restarts

The `restart_satisfactory.sh` script restarts the server daily to maintain optimal performance.

This is also configured via the `setup_crontab.sh` script to run daily at 5 AM.

### 5. Install the Web Interface (AMP)

To install and configure AMP to manage your Satisfactory server, run the following script:

```bash
sudo bash install_amp.sh
```

This script:
- Installs the prerequisites for AMP.
- Downloads and installs AMP.
- Creates an AMP instance for Satisfactory.
- Configures a firewall to allow access to the AMP web interface.
- **(Optional) Configures SSL with Certbot to secure the interface.**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Required Variable Changes

**For SSL Configuration in `install_amp.sh`:**

- **DOMAIN**: Replace `"your_domain.com"` with your actual domain name.
- **EMAIL**: Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your actual email address.

Example:

```bash
DOMAIN="example.com"
EMAIL="admin@example.com"
```

These variables are used to obtain an SSL certificate using Certbot.

### 6. Verify and Test Your Setup

Ensure everything is set up correctly:

- **Check Satisfactory Server Status**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status satisfactory
  ```

- **Check AMP Status**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status ampinstmgr@SatisfactoryInstance
  ```

## üîí Services and Security Configuration

- **UFW**: Ensure that the UFW firewall is enabled and configured to allow necessary ports.
- **Fail2Ban**: Fail2Ban is configured to protect against unauthorized login attempts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Management and Maintenance

### Main Commands

- **Start the server**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start satisfactory
  ```

- **Stop the server**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop satisfactory
  ```

- **Restart the server**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart satisfactory
  ```

- **Check server status**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status satisfactory
  ```

### Backups

Backups are stored in `/home/satisfactory/satisfactory_backups/` and are performed daily, with backups older than 7 days being deleted.

### Updates

The server is automatically updated via the `update_satisfactory.sh` script, which runs daily.

### Restart

The server is automatically restarted daily via the `restart_satisfactory.sh` script, which runs every day at 5 AM.

## üìù Final Remarks

These scripts are designed to make managing a Satisfactory server on Debian or Ubuntu easy and efficient, while using AMP for a powerful and intuitive web interface. They can be adapted to meet specific needs. Be sure to update the necessary variables in the scripts, such as the domain and email for SSL configuration in AMP.
